## Usage

### Running Scripts

You can run the classification, regression, and clustering scripts directly from the command line:

```sh
python src/classification.py
python src/regression.py
python src/clustering.py
```


## Classification

The classification module demonstrates how to use PySpark for binary classification tasks. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training various classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees)
- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
- Evaluation of models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Regression

The regression module covers how to use PySpark for regression tasks. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training different regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient-Boosted Tree Regressor)
- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
- Evaluation of models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R²

## Clustering

The clustering module demonstrates how to use PySpark for clustering tasks. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Gaussian Mixture)
- Evaluating clustering performance using metrics like silhouette score and within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)
